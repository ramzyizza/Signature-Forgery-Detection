# Signature-Forgery-Detection
This project utilizes Python's image-processing abilities to identify signature forgery. Utilizing a combination of Image Enhancement, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification, it systematically verifies signature properties. The approach uses Artificial Neural Networks to differentiate authentic signatures from forged ones.
